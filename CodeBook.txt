Code book describing the variables.

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Activity Labels:
  V1: Activity index
  V2: Activity label

Features - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.:
  V1: Feature Index
  V2: Feature label
  
Subject Test
  V1: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 2 to 24
  
Subject Train
  V1: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
  
X_test:
  V1-V50: Test set
y_test:
  V1: Test labels of activities by observation  
  
X_train:
  V1-V50: - Training set
y_train - Training labels:
  V1: Train labels of activities by observation  
  
df - merged datasets from Test and Train sets
MST_subset - indexes of features describes means or standard deviation for each measurement
df then subsetted by MST subset and added columns of subsets and activities

subject - binded rows of subjects from test and trains
activity - binded rows of activities from test and trains

activity_group - factors of datasource activites.

baseData - melted data from datasource by subject and activities
final_df - resulting dataframe from melted data with means by subject and activities data.
